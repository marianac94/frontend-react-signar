## MVP User Stories
* As a blogger/influencer, I would sign in and create a day by day diary where I could upload all my outfits, food, friends, trips and memories.

* As a mother, I would sign in so I could write all about my children memories and family trips.

* As a person who is studying I would sign in and start writing about my interests and I would start making posts so whenever I feel like having something worth sharing it, I would just click on the share function and added to one of my social media.
